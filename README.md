## Description

We aim to generate a series of models that can be used to infer how the basis of the lake pelagic ecosystem (plankton communities) will respond in their structure to environmental changes:

* relationship between warming, phosphorus and nitrogen levels on stability these communities and on toxic cyanobacterial abundances;
* forecasts about how these community responses will change under future scenarios of climate warming and nutrient levels.
